# Introduction
Within our project we intend to explore trends that exist within crime, particularly within Seattle. Through the exploration and synthesis of this data, we will draw connections between parameters including location, nature of crime, rates, and time. We will have an explicit focus on:

- What crimes are the most common in different districts of Seattle?
- How does the difference between time reported and time of incident reflect policy changes throughout time?
- At what time do most crimes occur? Does this differ across different geographic areas?
- How do the rates of different types of crime committed change across time?

These questions were motivated by the nature of the data we are using, as well as a curiosity in exploring larger societal trends within crime. Throughout contemporary society, many populations and communities are disproportionately criminalized. This can be examined through the criminalization of poverty, immigration status, mental illness, and race, among other identities. By exploring current occurrences of crime, we can inform potential policy change, and work to inform larger perceptions of crime, and the structural nature of their origin.

For instance, many crimes originate as a result of survival or criminalization of a marginalized identity. For many immigrant communities, particularly undocumented people, they cannot obtain a driver's license. This then makes these communities especially vulnerable to targeting by law enforcement officers and felony charges. Communities of color are also targeted through vagrancy laws and other policies that defer to police discretion.


# Conclusion / Summary Takeaways

Upon the completion of our project, looking at many of the themes presented throughout data analysis and visualization reveal key insights regarding the criminal justice system, namely the implications of our practices in recording crime and our patterns of surveillance. Marginalized communities, namely communities of color have higher rates of surveillance, particularly within institutions such as the police. The increasing intersectionality between the criminal justice system and other networks including hospitals, banks, and other surveilling institutions lead to system avoidance by those negatively impacted by the criminal justice system, and stratification among these communities.


In many ways law enforcement agencies are facilitating the goals of other institutions such as ICE. This is reflected in over policing and higher incarceration rates for people of color, and other marginalized communities. The criminalization of status (poverty, houselessness, race, mental illness, etc.) has similarly furthered these trends. Much of this collaboration leads to increased distrust in the communities being policed, and leads to underreported instances of crimes and violence committed against them. This also leads to less reporting of crime by people of color, which may be influencing the data we examined. Within contemporary society, there exists a vast power imbalance, with police often being granted deferential treatment and lack of accountability.


Within the specific aspects of our data, trends surrounding the surveillance and recording of crime are highlighted. Our data reflects trends in the recording of crime more than it records actual incidents of crime, due to a variety of reasons, actual crime is not always reported. In this sense I found the evolution of crime reports over time to be particularly interesting, particularly as the areas where the crime rate was the highest shifted to areas with higher population as time went on. This can be seen within Chart 1. Within this, there were significantly lower rates of crime in the 1900â€™s largely due to a lack of record keeping/maintenance. This leads to a broader distribution of the crimes we do have records of. In 1964 there were 1965 total reported crimes, while in 2017 there were 50,274 total reported crimes.


I also found these rates to be interesting since there has recently been a large political movement to reduce the rate of crime, specifically focusing on false rhetoric that immigrants and minority communities bring in higher rates of crime. However, today we have some of the lowest rates of crime nationwide. This is reflected through our data as from 2017 to 2018 the total number of committed crimes more than halved, with a decrease from 50,274 to 24,843.


Within this, the discrepancies illustrated within Graph 2 highlight the difference between reported crime and actual crime, although there is some unknown margin of error present within this as well.


Ultimately, the broader implication of this insight discusses trends of crime within Seattle, and can be used to inform policy change that can be used to address underlying issues of crime, namely policies that establish programs such as Housing-First to establish adequate resources for marginalized populations.
